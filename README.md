## Considerations
I have used CSS Grid technologies to build the site along with SASS to enable myself and any potential teammates to work on the project as seamless as possible. Grid allows me to build the website with resposiveness in mind and I believe is a robust technology when laying the scaffolding. Code was built keeping performance and accessibility in mind as well, with semantic code. Responsiveness was built with a 2560x1440 resolution and Iphone 6/7/8 Plus only, in real projects all screen sizes would be taken into account. The way the site is built allows us to scale for different resolutions easily. I have used an external slider on the banner section to enhance aesthethics. I have used Font Awesome and Google Fonts for design purposes. Most things can be done via CSS when it comes to animations but I have added a brief code to update the year on the footer. This way site would not look outdated with previous years' stamp later on.

I have tried to follow the instructions in the guidance document as much as I can with the time limit I had, but please keep in mind that last couple of sections are not coded due to time constraints, along with IE fixes and gauges styling. Rest assured I'm aware and know how to work on them.

Hope this will give an idea on my coding, thank you for your time!
